# Don't move this over to the release kgs entries.
# This ensures we get the newest versions when we update ROT.
# When updating GELB und BLAU we don't pin those packages so it takes the newest version from cache.
# The newest version in the cache is the one we used to update ROT. Thus we know the buildout will (probably) succeed.
